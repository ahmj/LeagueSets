## Documentation

### Adding sites
Open up the manifest and add your script with a url to the guides section of the site.

    {
        "matches": ["URL_OF_GUIDES_SECTION"],
        "js": ["./scripts/your_script"]
    },
    
Your script will follow the same structure as outlined below, where it will return a **BLOCKS** object when called.

    var BLOCKS;
    chrome.runtime.sendMessage({
        from:    'content',
        subject: 'showPageAction'
    });

    chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener(function(msg, sender, response) {
        if ((msg.from === 'popup') && (msg.subject === 'guide')) {
                //code here
            response(BLOCK);
        }
    });
    
The **BLOCKS**  object must contain a title, and multiple item blocks for your set. The item sets require a title, and a list of item ids.

    var BLOCKS = {
        title: "title_of_guide",
        items: [
            {
                header: "title_of_block",
                items: ["2003","2004, ..."]
            }, 
            {
             ..
            },
        ]
    };
    
Some sites may use there own custom item id's. In which case you will have to provide a JSON table of values to convert   
(Remeber to include this file in the manifest). There is a template, /scripts/templates/table_template.js that may be helpful. The mobafire script is an example of this.
